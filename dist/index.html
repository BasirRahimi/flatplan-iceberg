                            <p><strong>Account-based marketing (ABM)</strong> is essentially using a harpoon to catch a
                                customer, rather than casting your net into the ocean and hoping for the best.</p>
                            <p>ABM has become the most preferred marketing strategy in B2B because by focusing your
                                marketing resources and budgets on a specific shoal of accounts, you stand a greater chance
                                of success.</p>
                            <p>Unlike most marketing strategies, ABM is all about the unseen work – the actual marketing
                                itself is just the tip of the iceberg, as it were. The most vital element is what’s
                                underneath the account selection process, the research and the delivery.</p>
                            <p>This should include existing or past customers and new business prospects, and range in size
                                from a single whale to hundreds of minnow accounts. The size of your accounts will then
                                ultimately decide the type of ABM programme you should decide on; 1-to-1, 1 to few or 1 to
                                many.</p>

                                time here. It’s the hidden side of ABM that the customer will never see. Make your selection
                                based on evidence, using the data available to you.</p>
                        <p class="text-white">Data sources useful for key account selection include website visitor data,
                            CRM data, web enquiry information, current customer profiles, exploratory LinkedIn campaigns and

                            that can provide the insight and information treasures you need - <strong>LinkedIn, ListenLoop,
                                Netline, Owler, Nudge, Leadfeeder and LeadSift</strong> are just some of our favourites.</p>

                            must provide value. Be prepared to share expertise, experiences, advice and give things away –
